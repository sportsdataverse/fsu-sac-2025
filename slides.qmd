## How did you get started? {.smaller}

I attended the FSU Sports Analytics Summit 2020!

::: columns
::: {.column width="100%"}
I wrote up some of my thoughts and observations on incoming coach Mike Norvell's presentation on a handful of analytics-related topics. This became my first article for [Tomahawk Nation](https://www.tomahawknation.com/), the SBNation blog covering the Seminoles.

## Started meeting great folks online {.smaller}

Simultaneously, I started working with the `{cfbscrapR}` package (now archived) to help write analytics driven articles.

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
I would not be here without my collaborators from the `cfbscrapR` team:

-   [Meyappan Subbiah](https://twitter.com/msubbaiah1)
-   [Parker Fleming](https://twitter.com/statsowar)
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
```{r cfbscrapR-logo, eval = TRUE, out.width = "45%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saiemgilani/cfbscrapR/master/man/figures/logo.png")
```
:::
:::

::: columns
::: {.column width="70%"}
I quickly became involved with contributing to my first open-source package on [GitHub](https://github.com/sportsdataverse), eventually becoming a co-author. I then developed the successor to the package, [`{cfbfastR}`](https://cfbfastR.sportsdataverse.org).
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
```{r cfbfastR-logo-1, eval = TRUE, out.width = "45%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sportsdataverse/cfbfastR/main/man/figures/logo.png")
```
:::

. . .

## Went to another conference {.smaller}

- I used my experience from going to the FSU Sports Analytics Symposium to sharpen my networking and communication skills

- A couple weeks later, I went to the 2020 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference 

- Got to meet and see some sports analytics celebrities like Seth Partnow, John Hollinger, and [Alok Pattani](https://youtu.be/eNHlsI_8gaw)

- Competed in the Hackathon, an exceptional opportunity to work with and chat with very talented individuals about shared research ideas and further steps we could take with our projects



## Everything came to a screeching halt

<div class="tenor-gif-embed" data-postid="16564497" data-share-method="host" data-aspect-ratio="1.14286" data-width="70%" style="text-align: center;justify-content: center"><a href="https://tenor.com/view/rudy-gobert-nba-touching-the-mics-utah-jazz-gif-16564497">Rudy Gobert Nba GIF</a>from <a href="https://tenor.com/search/rudy+gobert-gifs">Rudy Gobert GIFs</a></div> <script type="text/javascript" async src="https://tenor.com/embed.js"></script>

. . . 

## Then, I had an idea `r emo::ji("light_bulb")`

I had a thought I am sure many of the long-standing members of the sports analytics community has had.

-   *what if getting sports data for analysis was easy?*

-   *what if we worked together to build the data infrastructure for research?*

-   *how much further would we get?*

. . .

. . .

## Why use the SportsDataverse? {.smaller}

The first public conversation on the SportsDataverse projects happened at the Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference. The [paper](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/conference/2021/assets/pdf/SaiemGilani.pdf) I wrote for the conference was selected as the winner for the Data and Software contribution, Open Track for their reproducible research competition.

-   It was built for you enthusiasts and soon-to-be entrants into the field
-   Allows users to quickly access seasons worth of datasets (which are updated nightly via automated [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/sportsdataverse/hoopR-nba-data/actions)) via loading function calls, taking the burden off users to maintain their own web scraping scripts
-   This in-turn provides significantly easier opportunities for reproducible research and reporting
